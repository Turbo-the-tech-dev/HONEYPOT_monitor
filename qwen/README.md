# HONEYPOT_monitor

A project dedicated to developing tools for monitoring honeypots to study and analyze attack patterns in a controlled and ethical manner.

## Description

The `HONEYPOT_monitor` project provides tools and systems to deploy, monitor, and analyze data from honeypots. The primary goal is to study attack patterns and understand attacker methodologies on your own controlled systems. This project is intended for proactive security research and defense, adhering strictly to ethical and white-hat principles.

## Features

As the project is in its early stages, the following features are envisioned:

*   Deployment strategies for various types of honeypots (e.g., web, SSH, IoT).
*   Robust log collection and aggregation mechanisms.
*   Data storage solutions for collected attack data.
*   Tools for analysis and visualization of attack patterns.
*   Automated deployment and management.
*   Advanced analysis features, potentially including machine learning.

## Installation

_Currently, the project is in the conceptual phase and does not have installable components. This section will be updated as the project develops._

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Turbo-the-tech-dev/HONEYPOT_monitor.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd HONEYPOT_monitor
    ```

## Usage

_Usage instructions will be provided once the first tools are developed._

## ⚠️ Safety Warnings

**CRITICAL:** Honeypots are designed to attract and engage attackers. They should **NEVER** be deployed on production networks or systems that contain sensitive data. Always run honeypots in a completely isolated environment (e.g., a dedicated VLAN, a separate physical network, or a sandboxed cloud environment) to prevent attackers from pivoting to other systems.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This project adheres to strict ethical guidelines. Please ensure any contributions align with white-hat security practices. Focus on passive monitoring, logging, and safe analysis. Do not add any real exploits or malicious capabilities.
