        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            The HONEYPOT_monitor project is focused on developing tools and systems to deploy, monitor, and analyze data from honeypots. The primary goal is to study attack patterns and understand attacker methodologies on your own controlled systems. This project is crucial for proactive security research and defense.
        </p>

        <h2>Current Features</h2>
        <p>As a new project, HONEYPOT_monitor is in its initial definition phase. The envisioned features include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deployment strategies for various types of honeypots (e.g., web, SSH, IoT).</li>
            <li>Robust log collection and aggregation mechanisms from deployed honeypots.</li>
            <li>Data storage solutions for collected attack data.</li>
            <li>Tools for analysis and visualization of attack patterns and trends.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Future of HONEYPOT_monitor</h2>
        <p>The future of HONEYPOT_monitor is to evolve into a comprehensive honeypot management and analysis platform. Future developments may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Automated honeypot deployment and management.</li>
            <li>Advanced machine learning-based attack pattern detection.</li>
            <li>Integration with threat intelligence platforms.</li>
            <li>User-friendly dashboards for real-time monitoring and reporting.</li>
            <li>Enhanced security measures for the monitoring system itself.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The project's progress and direction will be tracked through the issues in this repository.</p>
